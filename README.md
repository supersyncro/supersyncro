- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @supersyncro
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in communications security
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning batch file programming
- I've invented an unbreakable cryptography program
- that runs in windows command console as a batch file.
- It wasn't easy.  Nobody helped.  
- Problems abounded.  Couldn't get a blan space.
- Finally figured out arrays.  Then how to import the keys
- to the program for one time pad capability.  Program generates
- zero repeate ciphers, no patters, unbreakable.
- here's a screenshot â†’ https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xUmkzidH0iBEz7EM01z-xTiKGnS1CCd/view
